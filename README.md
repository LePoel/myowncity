# MyCity

This Readme.md is still in progress. We would like to deploy our project in the near future :) 

 ## Work with this Repo

 To work with the localversion with this code, you have to use a js packet manager like Node.js. 
Node.js includes npm. 

## Start the Local Version

Write all the commands in the terminal: 

1) npm install (downloads all the needed dependencies)

2) npm start (starts the local server)

Now you can access the local version via [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Have Fun :)
